<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

Go!Tweet makes it easy to connect your LabQuest, LabQuest Mini, or Go!
device and
send its data to Twitter. Follow these tips in case Go!Tweet has
trouble finding your interface.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

<ol>

  <li><i>Try searching again for devices. Go to File &gt; Search for
Devices</i><br>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure your device is powered on. When on, the LabQuest's
power button will have a blue ring around it. On a LabQuest mini,
Go!Motion, Go!Temp, and Go!Link a
red, amber, or green LED will indicate if it is on.</li>
  <li>Check if the interface's USB cord is properly connected to the
computer on one end and your interface on the other. Windows should
notify you when your device is connected or disconnected from your
computer.</li>
  <li>Make sure the appropriate drivers are installed and working
properly for your device. If you have Logger Lite, Logger <span style="font-style: italic;">Pro</span>,
or the LabQuest Emulator installed on your computer, you should already
have the necessary drivers. Otherwise, you can download the drivers as
a stand-alone package at <a href="http://www.vernier.com/drivers">http://www.vernier.com/drivers</a>.
Make sure to restart Go!Tweet after installing the drivers. If Go!Tweet
still does not work, try reinstalling the drivers because a
bad installation can cause the driver not to work.</li>
  <li>Go!Tweet may not be able to find your Go! device if Logger <i>Pro</i> or
Logger Lite are running. Please close them and then search for devices.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: Go!Tweet will connect to the
first interface it finds. Go!Tweet does not work with multiple
interfaces.</span>
